## marlin_configs (These are for the MKS Gev V1.4)
Various configs that I have found or modified for Marlin. They are built to use a BLTouch as the Z Min endstop. To disable all BLTouch items, you can reverse follow the guide [here](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/upgrades.html#bltouch)
**NOTE:** These config files have bed heating failsafes disabled. Do not use unless you know what you are doing.
